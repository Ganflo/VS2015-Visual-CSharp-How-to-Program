Visual C#: How to Program by Harvey &amp; Paul Dietel <br>
Edition: Global - Identical to US Version except the exercises <br>

*At the heart of the book is the Deitel signature live-code approach—rather than using code snippets, the authors present concepts in the context of complete working programs followed by sample executions. Students begin by getting comfortable with the Visual Studio Community edition IDE and basic C# syntax. Next, they build their skills one step at a time, mastering control structures, classes, objects, methods, variables, arrays, and the core techniques of object-oriented programming.* <br>
